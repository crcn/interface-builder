Immediate:

- [ ] styles MVP (make this usable FIRST so that we can get a feel for it)
  - [ ] style block
    - [ ] ability to insert style
    - [ ] ability to change key & value
    - [ ] ability to add value by pressing enter
    - [ ] wire up + button
  - [ ] computed inherited styles
    - [ ] compute enabled & disabled props
  - [ ] compute overridden props
  - [ ] prop value inputs
    - [ ] color picker (requires parser)
    - [ ] dropdown for enums (font family) - should be customizable
- [ ] move style prop to own tag (needed for multiple style blocks)
  - [ ] `variantId` prop
  - [ ]
- [ ] wire up attributes
  - [ ]

Maybe:

- [ ] pretty pane UI attached to each style block
