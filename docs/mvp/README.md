VSCode extension for previewing web components as they're being written.

Limitations:

immediate TODO:

- [ ] scoped styles
  - [ ] selector parsing
- [ ] JS context
- [ ] {{#if}} blocks
- [ ] {{#repeat }} blocks
- [ ] JS evaluator (need arrays for `<component context={{['something', 'something']}} />`)
- [ ] VSCode extension
  - [ ] realtime preview should be explicit (add vscode button)
  - [ ] realtime preview should be attached to loaded file

Stress test:

- [ ] render existing _large_ site (NYTimes, Webflow)

TODOS:

- [ ] example apps
  - [ ] chat app
  - [ ] build tandem
