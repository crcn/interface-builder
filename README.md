### Realtime visual development

Tandem allows you to visually develop your web application directly within VSCode. No more wasted time debugging HTML & CSS in the browser. 🙌🏻

> All of your web component development & debugging in one spot.

Tandem is built on top of [Paperclip](packages/paperclip), a super fast template language that compiles to React (more frameworks and languages will eventually be supported).

### Why?

Productivity & development speed. Debugging HTML & CSS is a long process, especially with bundlers like Webpack thrown into the mix. The goal around _Tandem_ is to provide visual tooling that helps cut down on development time by work eliminating bottlenecks. 

### Features

#### Designed to compile to any framework or language

#### Realtime development

#### Visual tooling

- measurement tools, responsive design, 

#### Type safety

- Linting







### What is Paperclip?

Paperclip is the super fast language used to create dynamic user interfaces. Here's an example:

```html

<!-- import a a tabs component -->
<import id="tabs" src="common/tabs.pc" />

<tabs>
  <div aria-label="Tab 1">
      some content
  </div>
  <div aria-label="Tab 2">
      more content
  </div>
  <div aria-label="Tab 2">
      more content
  </div>
</tabs>
```
