TODO:

- [ ] styles
- [ ] test large HTML page (copy paste TONS of divs till ~10mb)
  - [ ] optimize (if still slow, then Rust isn't viable)
- [ ] diff/patch

Nice to haves:

- [ ] @import in styles

- [ ] load html from local file
- [ ] virtual fs
- [ ] diff & patch to JS
- [ ] rendered output
- [ ] parse _big_ HTML page
- [ ] syntax error handling
  - [ ] probably via pipes


- [ ] need to benchmark rust performance w/ parsing & evaluating 
- [ ] need to figure out how to include plugins
  - [ ] i18n
  - rust + js basically
- [ ] evaluator
